    "\n",
    "NVIDIA Data Loading Library (DALI) is a collection of highly optimized building blocks and an execution engine that accelerates the data pipeline for computer vision and audio deep learning applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Input and augmentation pipelines provided by Deep Learning frameworks fit typically into one of two categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "* fast, but inflexible - written in C++, they are exposed as a single monolithic Python object with very specific set and ordering of operations it provides\n",
    "* slow, but flexible - set of building blocks written in either C++ or Python, that can be used to compose arbitrary data pipelines that end up being slow. One of the biggest overheads for this type of data pipelines is Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) in Python. This forces developers to use multiprocessing, complicating the design of efficient input pipelines.\n",
    " \n",
    "DALI stands out by providing both performance and flexibility of accelerating different data pipelines. It achieves that by exposing optimized building blocks which are executed using simple and efficient engine, and enabling offloading of operations to GPU (thus enabling scaling to multi-GPU systems).\n",
    "\n",
    "It is a single library, that can be easily integrated into different deep learning training and inference applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "DALI offers ease-of-use and flexibility across GPU enabled systems with direct framework plugins, multiple input data formats, and configurable graphs. DALI can help achieve overall speedup on deep learning workflows that are bottlenecked on I/O pipelines due to the limitations of CPU cycles. Typically, systems with high GPU to CPU ratio are constrained on the host CPU, thereby under-utilizing the available GPU compute capabilities. DALI significantly accelerates input processing on such dense GPU configurations to achieve the overall throughput."

    "\n",
    "Here is an example that demonstrates how to combine the COCO Reader, which loads data from a COCO dataset, with some of the typical augmentations used in image detection and segmentation use cases. The COCO dataset consists of a directory with images and an annotations file containing information about bounding boxes, labels and segmentation masks.\n",
    "\n",
    "A typical augmentation applied in detection and segmentation use cases is a random crop of the image with the restriction that at least one ground truth box is present in the cropped image. In DALI, we use RandomBBoxCrop for that. RandomBBoxCrop operator takes as an input the bounding boxes and the labels associated with them, and a set of constraints for the cropping operation. The result are the cropping window anchor and shape, as well as the processed bounding boxes and labels. The anchor and shape outputs, expressed in relative coordinates, can be directly fed into DALI's Slice operator to extract the region of interest of the image. The output bounding boxes and labels are processed to contain only the ones within the cropping window, and the coordinates are mapped to the new coordinate space. RandomBBoxCrop does not process segmentation masks, so the mask coordinates need to be mapped to the new coordinate space separately."

    "\n",
    "### Warp Operators\n",
    "All warp operators work by calculating the output pixels by sampling the source image at transformed coordinates:\n",
    "\n",
    "${Out}(x, y) = {In}(x_{src}, y_{src})$\n",
    "\n",
    "This way each output pixel is calculated exactly once.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the source coordinates do not point exactly to pixel centers, the values of neighboring pixels will be interpolated or the nearst pixel is taken, depending on the interpolation method specified in the `interp_type` argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Affine Transform\n",
    "\n",
    "The operators from `transforms` module can generate and combine transform matrices for different kinds of affine transforms. An affine transform is defined by the formula:\n",

    "Where $X_{in}$ is an input point, $X_{out}$ - the corresponding output, $M$ - linear part of the transformation and $T$ - a translation vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the points are in 2D space, the formula can be written as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\n",
    "\\begin{vmatrix}\n",
    "x_{out} \\\\\n",
    "y_{out}\n",

    "\\end{vmatrix}\n",
    "$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Transform Catalogue\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several transforms available in `transforms` module. Each of these operators can generate an affine transform matrix and combine it with a pre-existing transform. Here's the list of available transforms:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `rotation` - rotate by given angle (in degrees) around given point and axis (for 3D only)\n",
    "* `translation` - translate by given offset\n",
    "* `scale` - scale by given factor\n",
    "* `shear` - shear by given factors or angles; there are 2 shear factors for 2D and 6 factors for 3D\n",
    "* `crop` - translates and scales so that input corners (`from_start`, `from_end`) map to output corners (`to_start`, `to_end`).\n",
    "\n",
    "The documentation of the operators contains the detailed information about their parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "There's also the operator `combine` which combines multiple affine transforms."
